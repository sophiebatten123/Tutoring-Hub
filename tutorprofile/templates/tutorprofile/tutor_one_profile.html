            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>I am a recent graduate from Manchester University with a degree in Chemistry and am also able to
                teach Maths and Physics to 'A' level. I have been told that my approach to teaching makes it
                enjoyable for my students as I am considered patient and very approachable. I am happy to travel
                up to 15 miles from my home and am currently available evenings and week-ends.</p>
            <p>I am a recently retired Head teacher of a Primary School and have more than 35 years experience
                of teaching of pupils of all ages. Since retiring, I have given private tuition to a number of pupils
                with excellent results. I always have the highest expectations of pupils and always have had, even
                when it was fashionable for learning to be more "child centred". This is an approach I have found to
                pay rich dividends in terms of a pupil's academic and personal development.</p>
