# STEM Tutoring Site

(Developer: Sophie Batten)

STEM Tutoring offers secondary school pupils world class tuition FREE as part of the education recovery plan. It is vital, now more than ever, that students are able gain a deeper relational understanding of concepts and understand the practical nature of STEM subjects, all of which have been set aside throughout the pandemic. Our tutors deliver their lesson via [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software?rtc=1) which ensures no smart technology is required and gives all pupils regardless of their background the opportunity to learn.

The site is fully responsive and designed in a simplistic and easy to navigate manner. It has been coded using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django using the MVC framework to scaffold the design process. Furthermore, the project went through continuos agile development to ensure features were working effectively.
