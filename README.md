# TutoHub

(Developer: Sophie Batten)

TutorHub offers secondary school pupils world class tuition FREE as part of the education recovery plan. It is vital, now more than ever, that students are able gain a deeper relational understanding of concepts and understand the practical nature of STEM subjects, all of which have been set aside throughout the pandemic. Our tutors deliver their lesson via [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software?rtc=1) which ensures no smart technology is required and gives all pupils regardless of their background the opportunity to learn.

The site is fully responsive and designed in a simplistic and easy to navigate manner. It has been coded using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django using the MVC framework to scaffold the design process. Furthermore, the project went through continuos agile development to ensure features were working effectively.

# Site Improvements

# Features

## Register/ Login

- Upon entering the site users have the option to sign up for an account or, if already registered, login to their pre-existing accounts. (User Story 1)
- This feature allows the user to book in lessons, leave tutor reviews and share their work. 
- Furthermore, it allows the user to have a more personalised experience on the site showing their information and allowing them to keep track of any upcoming bookings. 
- The login and register pages use the 'Django Allauth Framework'. They have further been styled to blend with the design of the site using colours that complement the rest of the page.

# Deployed Website

## Desktop Homepage

![Desktop-Homepage]()

Above is a screenshot of the deployed webiste in desktop view. It was really important throughout the design process that the layout was simplistic and that the main focus of the site was to get users to book lessons hence why this was central to the page.

## Mobile Homepage

![Mobile-Homepage]()

A screenshot of the website from a mobile device can be seen above. The site remained easy to navigate on mobile devices and the design ensured that the content was clear.
